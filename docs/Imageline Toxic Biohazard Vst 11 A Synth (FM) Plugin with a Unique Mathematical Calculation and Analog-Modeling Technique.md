If you are looking for a versatile and powerful synthesizer plugin that can produce a wide range of sounds, from warm pads and leads to crisp bells and drums, you might want to check out Image-Line Toxic Biohazard VST 11. This plugin is a hybrid synthesizer that combines the best of frequency modulation (FM) and subtractive synthesis, with a warm, analog-modeled filter and a set of built-in effects. In this article, we will show you how to use this plugin to create amazing sounds for your music production.
 
## What is Image-Line Toxic Biohazard VST 11?
 
Image-Line Toxic Biohazard VST 11 is the latest version of Image-Line's hybrid software synthesizer, featuring an optimized engine for improved sound quality, with even more accurate wave shapes, and quicker rendering times[^1^]. It is compatible with macOS and Windows, and it functions as a VST plugin and an Audio Units plugin. You can also use it as a standalone application or inside FL Studio.

The plugin has six oscillators that can generate both synthetic and acoustic waveforms. You can load your own samples in WAV or AIFF format, or choose from 32 built-in classic waveforms that are useful for FM synthesis. The oscillators are completely alias-free, and produce a rich, "fat" sound across the spectrum[^2^]. You can also modulate the oscillators with each other, or with external sources, to create complex and dynamic sounds.
 
The plugin also has a filter section that features a 12 dB/octave low-pass filter with resonance and envelope modulation. The filter is modeled after an analog circuit, and it adds warmth and character to the sound. You can adjust the filter cutoff frequency, resonance, envelope amount, attack, decay, sustain, and release parameters to shape the sound to your liking.
 
The plugin also has an effects section that includes distortion, chorus, delay, reverb, flanger, and phaser effects. The effects are designed to give you access to several types of effects, from aggressive, tube-like distortion, to warm stereo delay, reverb, flanger, and phaser effects[^3^]. You can adjust the effect parameters to add depth, width, movement, and color to your sound. You can also chain the effects in any order you want.
 
## How to Use Image-Line Toxic Biohazard VST 11?
 
To use Image-Line Toxic Biohazard VST 11, you need to install it on your computer and load it as a plugin in your DAW of choice. You can also run it as a standalone application if you prefer. Once you load the plugin, you will see its user interface that consists of four main sections: Oscillators, Filter/Envelope/LFOs/Modulation Matrix/Arpeggiator/Sequencer (FELMAS), Effects/Output/Master Volume (EOMV), and Presets/Browser/Options (PBO).
 
The first thing you need to do is to choose a preset from the PBO section. You can browse through hundreds of presets that are categorized by type (Bass, Lead, Pad, etc.), or by genre (Trance, House, etc.). You can also use the search function to find a preset by name or keyword. Once you find a preset that you like, you can load it by clicking on it.
 
The next thing you need to do is to tweak the preset to suit your needs. You can start by adjusting the oscillator parameters in the Oscillators section. You can change the waveform type, volume level, pan position, tuning (coarse and fine), phase offset, and stereo width of each oscillator. You can also enable or disable FM modulation for each oscillator pair (Osc 1 & 2, Osc 3 & 4, Osc 5 & 6), and adjust the modulation amount and ratio. You can also enable or disable noise generation for each oscillator pair.
